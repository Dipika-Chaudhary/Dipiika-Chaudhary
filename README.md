Kanban System History: The Beginning

Kanban history has its origins in the Toyota Production System (TPS) invented by Taiichi Ohno. A director who had come up through the machine shop, Ohno sought to eliminate waste on the production line. Two of the areas he identified were overproduction and inventory: It was wasteful to make too many cars, but also wasteful to have unused raw materials sitting on the factory floor. His solution drew inspiration from supermarket operations, where food is stocked according to demand.
Applying this principle to factory production proved relatively simple: For each new car, a card containing instructions and supply information would be attached to the product during assembly, and move with it throughout the production process. Once the car was sold, the card would be returned to the start of the chain. When a predetermined number of cards were waiting to be reassigned to a product, this would signal the need for new cars to enter production, triggering an order of materials from the warehouse. The cards, named kanbans after the Japanese word for signboard, provided a visual aid to track a task from start to finish. By 1963, Kanban was in use at all Toyota plants. The manufacturing industry at large would take notice of the method and decades later, these principles would be applied to software development.
